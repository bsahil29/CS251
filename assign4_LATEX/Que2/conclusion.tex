In this document, we have provided a discussion on sorting algorithms. We included algorithms for \textbf{Quicksort} and explained its working. Further, a proof of lower bounds on sorting is presented in this document. Most of the content presented here is created by referring and reproducing contents from one of the widely followed book on Algorithms by Cormen et al. \cite{cormen}. We do not claim originality of this work. This document is prepared as part of an assignment for the Software Lab Course (CS251) to learn \LaTeX.
